<p><i>Akal's bookstore was founded in 2019 by Sarah and Maria,best friends who noticed the absence of online bookstores
        that solely stock
        books by African authors.The idea was born out of their own need to find a collection of books by African
        authors under one roof. The two recall detesting the long walks from one bookstore to another in search of books
        by African authors,especially non contemporary ones.The bookstore therefore seeks to promote local and African
        literature and ensuring customer convenience while at it. The founders beleive that literature is a powerful
        tool of change in society.</i></P>
